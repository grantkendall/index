        <p>I like to think and I like to think I think about the web differently. From my perspective, most of the web looks pretty similar. How is it possible a tool that everyone on Earth uses looks the same? How is it possible that an <a href="">edgeless</a>, infinitely expansive medium settled for the same? That doesn't seem right to me. What does it <em>mean</em> to scroll? What does a hyperlink <em>mean</em> in the age of data extraction? I like to think making art that questions itself makes my opinion different than other designers. I could be wrong about that; wouldn't it be fun to find out?</p>

        <p>I'm interested in the history of the web. I'm interested in the history of communication networks. I feel an obligation to ensure my participation in web-building is constructive whilst advocating for best carbon practices.</p>
